# samtools-docker
## Samtools build done with v1.16.1

In this case, the conda install does not work -- instead, this Dockerfile gets the release.

[Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/download/)

Steps to build this docker container.
1. Determine the dependencies by iterative running of .configure
2. Use ubuntu base image
3. get each of the dependencies
4. run the steps specified for [building and installing](http://www.htslib.org/download/)

To edit the files:
1. Use a simple editor (Text Edit on Mac is fine) - we want to be cautious about unseen characters
2. Use emacs (can be installed with conda)
```bash
conda install -c conda forge emacs
```

To build your image from the command line:
* Can do this on [Google shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com) - docker is installed and available

```bash
docker build -t samtools:v1.16.1 .
```

To test this tool from the command line 

Set up an environment variable capturing your current command line:
```bash
PWD=$(pwd)
```

Then mount and use your current directory and call the tool now encapsulated within the environment.

Any samtools command can be used to check.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD samtools:v1.16.1 samtools --version
```

## (Optional) Deposit your container in the your [CAVATICA](cavatica.sbgenomics.com)  Docker Registry

If you are working with Kids First or INCLUDE data, and you are registered with either the [Kids First DRC](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) or the [INCLUDE Data Hub](https://includedcc.org/), you have access to a platform as a service, CAVATICA by Seven Bridges.

If you do, you Docker Image Repository Specific to you is at the location of pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/[YOUR CAVATICA USERNAME]

There are three steps to building and using a container

1. build
2. tag
3. push

We have built and we did tag this (I built the above on my desktop which is a mac, but it could have been built within a google shell.  Examples of how to do this are found in the [Elements of Style in Workflow Creation and Maintenance, Day 3](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD/Kids-First-Elements-of-Style-Workflow-Creation-Maintenance/blob/main/classes/Building-A-Nextflow-Script/README.md#preamble-to-building-workflows-using-containers)

### Tag

To tag the image just built, you need the image id, to get that simply use the command **`docker images`**.

```bash
docker images
REPOSITORY                                           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
samtools                                            latest    0ca8aaf01be0   16 minutes ago   1.53GB
```

Now we re-tag it for pushing to our own personal [CAVATICA](cavatica.sbgenomics.com) docker container registry.

```bash
docker tag 0ca8aaf01be0 pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/[YOUR CAVATICA USERID]/samtools:v1.16.1
```

### Docker registry login

There is actually another step required before you can do your push to the registry.  You need to authenticate.

Navigate to the CAVATICA Developers Tab.

Select Authentication Token, if you have not done so, generate that token.

Then Copy the token and paste it in the proper location in the command below (after -p for password)

```bash
docker login pgc-images.sbgenomics.com -u [YOUR CAVATICA USERNAME] -p [YOUR AUTHENTICATION TOKEN]
```

### Push

Now that we have

* tagged :whitecheck our docker image and

* we have authenticated :whitecheck 

```bash
docker push pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/[YOUR CAVATICA USERNAME]/samtools:v1.16.1
```

You know things are going correctly when you see something to the effect of:


```bash
The push refers to repository [pgc-images.sbgenomics.com/deslattesmaysa2/samtools:v1.16.1]
